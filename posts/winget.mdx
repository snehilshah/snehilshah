### Overwiew

You must be familiar with the **package managers** like `apt` or `yum` in Linux,
or the package managers like `pip` or `npm` in Python and Node which come pre-installed.

Winget is the client interface to the **Windows Package Manager** service. The winget command line tool enables users to discover, install, upgrade, remove and configure applications on Windows 10 and Windows 11 computers.

#### What does this mean for you?

You no longer need to manually search online for setup files or worry about downloading and storing them locally yourself. Winget automates these processes, making software installation a breeze.

  Winget fetches the necessary files from trusted sources and is even
  recommended by <br /> <b>Microsoft</b>

#### How to use it?

The winget commands are very simple and easy to use. Let us quickly go forward and see how to use it.

  ```bash
  winget search <appname>

### Conclusion

Windows has being the most used operating system since a long time, Mostly because of its user-friendly interface and extensive software compatibility.
However, Windows often falls short in delivering the robust and customizable capabilities found in Linux or Mac.
Linux emerges as a compelling alternative, boasting powerful features, open-source flexibility, and a thriving community-driven ecosystem that helps to the needs of both novice users and seasoned professionals.
By using winget, we are making our windows experience better and more productive.
