# Browsers: The Gateway to Internet

## Breaking Free from the Chrome's Reign

Browsers can change the way we look at the internet. From ads to pop-ups, from blogs to articles and from music to videos. Selecting a single browser from this crusade is like a war with oneself.

I have forever been using the king of them all - **CHROME!!** Not knowing what features could even exist in a browser and do I even need them? Chrome was the status quo and was installed blindly on every device I ever browse. It is just so simple and reliable that everyone uses it. **No Question Asked!!**.

History has shown us that browser supremacy is a fleeting throne. Netscape once ruled the 90s until it vanished. Internet Explorer dominated the early 2000s, so much that its successor Edge is still suffering from its success :). Each browser giant eventually falls. Now Chrome, with its 65%+ market share (as of Feb, 2025), shows similar signs: recent lawsuit for unfair monopoly, Manifest-v3 changes that cripple many extensions and suspicious privacy policies that treat your data like a free candy.

## My "Brave" Revelation ü¶Å

Then came my epiphany ‚Äì a sudden moment of clarity that made me question the norm and explore new horizons beyond the familiar. I came across this reddit post, that talked about a new browser called **Brave**. At the moment all I saw was that it can block youtube ads, and **I was sold**. I never knew that we can even block ads? felt like cheating the system. This marked the beginning of my journey to actually customize my browsing experience, and taking steps to protect my online privacy.

Brave felt perfect! It was built on the same Chromium engine as Chrome. It was privacy-focused, had built-in ad-blocker. The browser was fast, the ad-blocker was effective and the privacy features were top-notch. The experience was refreshing.

Brave's choices sometimes diverge from the idea of a zenful, private, and open platform.  The cryptocurrency integration, search engine, and sponsored content. Pushing the Brave VPN. Most of all the reliance on Chromium.  A shift was needed.  However, no other browser offered a better alternative.
