# Browsers: The Gateway to Internet

## Breaking Free from the Chrome's Reign

Browsers can change the way we look at the internet. From ads to pop-ups, from blogs to articles and from music to videos. Selecting a single browser from this crusade is like a war with oneself.

I have forever been using the king of them all - **CHROME!!** Not knowing what features could even exist in a browser and do I even need them? Chrome was the status quo and was installed blindly on every device I ever browse. It is just so simple and reliable that everyone uses it. **No Question Asked!!**.

History has shown us that browser supremacy is a fleeting throne. Netscape once ruled the 90s until it vanished. Internet Explorer dominated the early 2000s, so much that it's successor Edge is still suffering from its success :). Each browser giant eventually falls. Now Chrome, with its 65%+ market share (as of Feb, 2025), shows similar signs: recent lawsuit for unfair monopoly, suspicious privacy policies that treat your data like an all-you-can-eat buffet, Manifest-v3 changes that cripple many extensions.

The ubiquitous nature of web browsers, exemplified by Chrome's dominance, masks the inherent volatility of browser supremacy.  While Chrome's simplicity and reliability have fostered widespread adoption, its current market leadership is precarious, mirroring the historical downfall of previous browser giants like Netscape and Internet Explorer.  Emerging challenges, including antitrust concerns and privacy controversies, suggest that Chrome's reign may be similarly ephemeral.
