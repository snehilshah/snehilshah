# Browsers: The Gateway to the Internet

Browsers can change the way you look at the internet. From ads to pop-ups, from blogs to articles and from music to videos. Selecting a single browser from this crusade is like a war with oneself.

I have forever been using the king of them all - CHROME!! Not knowing what features could even exist in a browser and do I even need them?
