## How do Themes Work?

A Visual Studio Code theme works just like an Extension. Which leads to the question how do VS Code Extensions Work?

VS Code Extensions are a collection of **JSON** files in the folder `.vscode/extenstions` inside your user directory. You can check this folder in your computer by going to the path `%UserProfile%/.vscode/extension`

This JSON file will contain all the rule mappings of your VS CODE UI elements to your color properties.

Example:

<CodeBox
  code='"button.foreground": "#ffffff",
"button.hoverBackground": "#6087cf",
"diffEditor.insertedTextBackground": "#00809b33",
"dropdown.background": "#353b45",
"dropdown.border": "#181a1f",
"editor.background": "#282c34",
"editor.findMatchHighlightBackground": "#528bff3d",
"editor.foreground": "#abb2bf",'
/>

## Creating the Theme Files

To create a theme you will need to have a folder structure. We have many tools that can do that for us. Here we will be using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) to create our folder structure.

### Installing Yeoman & code-genrator

<WarningBox text='You will need to have NodeJS installed in your computer to use Yeoman' />

- Navigate to the folder where you want to create theme.
- Open terminal and type: `npm i -g yo code-generator`

  - `npm`: Stands for _node package manager_ which comes pre-installed with NodeJS, it helps us to download and install packages.

  - `i`: **i** stands for _install_.

  - `-g`: **g** stands for _global_, it will install the package globally in your computer.

  - `yo`: yo stands for yeoman, yeoman is an open source client-side scaffolding tool which will scaffold the file structure for us.

### Running Yoeman Code Generator

Open the terminal and run `yo code`

This guy ðŸ‘† yeoman will ask you some questions.

Select the following:

- New Color Theme
- No, start fresh
- Give your theme a name, I will be using **Cosmic Gleam**
- Give your theme a identifier, I will be using **cosmic-gleam**
- The description of your theme, you can keep it empty for now.
- Give it a Display Name, this name will be show to the user
- Select a base Theme, I will be using **Dark**
- It is advised to Initialize a git repository, so select **Yes**

My terminal after entering all the details:

Your Folder Structure must look something like this:

```markdown
â”‚ .gitattributes
â”‚ .gitignore
â”‚ .vscodeignore
â”‚ CHANGELOG.md
â”‚ package.json
â”‚ README.md
â”‚ vsc-extension-quickstart.md
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€.vscode
â”‚ launch.json
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€â”€themes
| Cosmic Gleam-color-theme.json
```

## Creating the Theme

Now that we are having the whole project setup, we can start creating the theme.

Open the `theme` folder in your project and go to the `.json` file with your theme name.

Here the json files contains all the rules for the theme. You can change the color of any element by changing the value of the property.

To test the theme press `F5` or go to `Run > Start Debugging` in the VS Code Menu. This will open a new window with your theme applied.

<InfoBox text='Creating a theme from scratch is a very long process, you can use [Theme Generator](https://themes.vscode.one/) to generate a theme and then edit it.' />

## Publishing the Theme

### DevOps Personal Access Token

To publish our theme we will need a **Azure Dev Ops** account. You can create one by going to [Azure Website](https://dev.azure.com) and clicking on `Start Free`.

Once logged in, Create a **Personal Access Token**

- Click on your profile settings icon in the top right corner.
- Select **Personal Access Tokens**
- Click on **New Token**
- Give it a name and select **All Accessible organizations** in organization dropdown.
- Custom Define Expiration and set it to 1 year.(Maximum allowed)
- Scroll down and check the **Manage Button** in Marketplace section.
- Click on Create Button
- Copy the token and save it somewhere safe.(Do not share it with anyone)

### Becoming a Publisher

- Go to [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage)
- Click on **Create Publisher**
- Fill in the Name and ID and click on **Create Publisher**

### Configuring Package File

- In your project folder open the `package.json` file.
- Add a field `publisher` and set it to your publisher ID.
- Add a field `repository` and set it to your repository URL.

You can add many more Attributes to the `package.json` file.
For all the attributes checkout the [`package.json`](https://github.com/srshah27/cosmic-gleam/blob/main/package.json) file from my repository.

> You will need to update your `readme.md` file as you want be allowed to publish otherwise.

## Uploading the Theme

Finally, to upload the extension you will need `vsce` package. Run `npm i -g vsce` in your terminal to install it.

Login to your Azure DevOps account by running `vsce login <publisher-id>`, if asked for Personal Access Token, paste the token you copied earlier.

Now run `vsce package` to create a `.vsix` file in your project folder. The `.vsix` file is the zip file of your extension.

Finally run `vsce publish` to publish your theme to the marketplace.

You can now go to your publisher profile and see your theme published.
