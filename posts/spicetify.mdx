## What is <Standout text='Spicetify?'/>

[Spicetify](https://spicetify.app/) is a third-party tool that allows you to customize the Spotify desktop app's appearance and features. I hear a lot of people saying that these softwares are malwares and virus and one should never use them.
I want to clear this out that **Spicetify is not a malware or a virus.** It is an open-source project and guarded by the eyes of the community

> Spicetify is made by the community for the community

### Why should you use Spicetify?

1. No Ads âœ¨
1. Custom Themes ðŸŽ¨
1. Extensions ðŸ§©

## Installation

Spicetify has a pretty straightforward installation process. You can install it using the following commands

<InfoBox text='You will need spotify installed before installing Spicetify' />

```ps1
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/master/install.ps1 | iex
```

This will install spicetify, but we also want **spicetify marketplace** for downloading themes and extensions ðŸ‘‡

```ps1
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-marketplace/main/resources/install.ps1 | iex
```

<StyleBox>ðŸŽ‰ Spicetify is now installed we can start customizing it now</StyleBox>

## Customization

### Themes

Once installed you will get a tab for marketplace in your spotify

1. Click on Marketplace
1. Select Themes Tab
1. Click on the small download button on the theme you want to install
1. Reload Spotify if asked

  text='Click on Marketplace and then navigate to Themes tab'
/>

<StyleBox>I personally use the theme <Standout text='Bloom' /></StyleBox>

### Extensions

Similar to Themes select the Extensions tab and download the extensions you want

I would like to mention some honourable extensions that I use:

- AdBlock (obviously) ðŸ˜Œ
- Cover Ambience (shows a beutiful blurred album cover in the background)
- Full App Display (Album cover art on the full screen see Image Below ðŸ‘‡)

## Updates

The good thing about spicetify is that it is actively been upgraded and hence you recieve all the latest updates and features Spotify is pushing

Spotify, every now and then, updates its client. Since we have no power over this process, you will likely need to re-apply Spicetify.

If there are major changes to spotify we will have to re-apply spicetify

```bash
spicetify upgrade
```

If no update for Spicetify is available, it means that it still works by simply running

```bash
spicetify backup apply
```

After running spicetify upgrade,(i.e updates were installed) you will be prompted to run

```bash
spicetify restore backup apply
```

you will have everything back where it was, your settings are saved!!

## Conclusion

Spicetify provides me everything that I would want from Spotify.
It literally has a <Standout text='burning spotify logo.'/> That logo was my selling point.
