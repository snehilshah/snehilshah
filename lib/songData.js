[Verse 1]
Whispers in the morning light
A gentle breeze, a calming sight
Sunbeams dancing on the floor
Nature's song, I can't ignore

[Chorus]
Oh, the world is full of grace
In this quiet, peaceful place
Every moment, a sweet sound
Love and beauty all around

    lyrics: `
[Verse 1]
Colors painting up the sky
As the day is saying goodbye
Golden hues and shades of red
Peaceful thoughts inside my head

[Chorus]
Sunset vibes, a magic show
Watch the colors ebb and flow
In this moment, I am free
Just the sunset, sky, and sea
[Verse 1]
Colors painting up the sky
As the day is saying goodbye
Golden hues and shades of red
Peaceful thoughts inside my head

[Chorus]
Sunset vibes, a magic show
Watch the colors ebb and flow
In this moment, I am free
Just the sunset, sky, and sea
